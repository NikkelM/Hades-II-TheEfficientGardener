# The Efficient Gardener

This mod allows you to plant and harvest multiple plants at once in your Garden.

Harvesting will now always harvest all fully grown plants, instead of just the currently selected one.

Instead of planting a single seed in an empty plot, you can now also "Plant All", which will plant as many seeds of the selected type as you have in your inventory across all empty plots.

*Note: Even though the mod has not been fully localized, the "Harvest All" and "Plant All" interactions still work in other language versions. For harvesting, the normal "Harvest" button works, for planting all, the "Admire" interaction is replaced.*
