# The Efficient Gardener

<!-- ![icon](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6eade79-4196-420a-90c5-32828260336d) -->

This mod allows you to plant and harvest multiple plants at once in your Garden.

If a seed can be planted or a plant harvested from the current plot, the "Admire" prompt will be replaced with a "Plant All" or "Harvest All" button.

When "Planting All", as many of the selected seed as possible will be planted, up to the amount in your inventory.
