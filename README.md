# The Efficient Gardener

This mod allows you to plant and harvest multiple plants at once in your Garden.

Harvesting will now always harvest all fully grown plants, instead of just the currently selected one.

Instead of planting a single seed in an empty plot, you can now also "Plant All", which will plant as many seeds of the selected type as you have in your inventory across all empty plots.
